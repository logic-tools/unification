## Formalization of First-Order Syntactic Unification 

### Kasper Fabæch Brandt, Anders Schlichtkrull & Jørgen Villadsen

We present a new formalization in the Isabelle proof assistant of first-order syntactic unification,
including a proof of termination.
Our formalization follows, almost down to the letter, the ML-code from Baader and Nipkow's book
"Term Rewriting and All That" (1998).
Correctness is implied by the formalization's similarity to Baader and Nipkow's ML-code,
but we have yet to formalize the correctness of the unification algorithm.
